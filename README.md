# Data Visualization Project

The report is available at the root of the project.

All the data sets can be found in _data_. 

Most of the subjects discussed in the report been studied in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. All notebooks are available in _jupyter_notebooks_.

_mindmaps_ contains our way of thinking throughout some of the subjects.

_papers_ contain the pdf version of the 3 papers/books used for this project.

_sugar_ and _swiss R plot_ contain the corresponding resulting visualizations. Those are the only results that are not part of a Jupyter Notebook.

Thank you Johan for your support. :)
